## Contribution of GHG to Global Warming

CO₂ (Carbon Dioxide): ~76%
CH₄ (Methane): ~16%
N₂O (Nitrous Oxide): ~6%
F-gases (Fluorinated gases): ~2%

## Human causes of GHG emissions include

- Fossil fuel combustion (energy production, transportation, industry)
- Deforestation and land-use changes
- Industrial processes (cement, steel production)
- Agriculture (livestock, rice paddies)
- Waste management (landfills, wastewater treatment)

## Natural causes of GHG emissions include:

- Volcanic eruptions (CO₂, CH₄)
- Wetlands (methane production)
- Ocean-atmosphere exchange (CO₂ release)
- Wildfires (CO₂ release)
- Decomposition of organic matter in soils (CO₂, CH₄)

## To map between human and natural causes of GHG emissions for global warming:

1. **Compare datasets** for human-caused emissions (fossil fuel use, deforestation) and natural emissions (wetlands, ocean-atmosphere exchange).
2. **Analyze emission trends** over time to quantify their respective contributions.
3. **Overlay spatial data** (e.g., land-use, volcanic activity) with GHG concentration maps to differentiate sources.
4. **Use model-based estimates** to predict the impact of each source type on global warming


Part 1:
To map between datasets using **mean**, **min**, **max**, **sum**, and **std**:

1. **Compare means and sums**: Higher values in human-caused emissions (e.g., CO₂ from fossil fuels) indicate greater overall contribution compared to natural emissions.
   
2. **Examine variability (std)**: Larger **std** in human-caused emissions may reflect higher variability due to industrial activities, while natural causes might show more stability.

3. **Use min/max values**: Higher **max** values in human datasets may signal significant spikes (e.g., industrial events) compared to more steady natural emissions.

4. **Draw conclusion**: If human-caused datasets consistently show higher **mean**, **sum**, and **max** values, it indicates they contribute more significantly to GHG emissions and global warming than natural causes.
